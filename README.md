# Rosie Kipling Quarto Portfolio Starter

A polished Quarto website that doubles as a portfolio/CV with featured data projects — now golf‑focused.

## Quick start

1. Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
2. In this folder, run:
   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```
3. Edit `_quarto.yml`, `index.qmd`, `cv.qmd`, `projects.qmd`, and posts in `posts/`.
4. Push to a new GitHub repo (`main` branch).
5. In GitHub → Settings → Pages → set source to **GitHub Actions**.
6. (Optional) Set a custom domain; add DNS and a `CNAME`.

## Notes
- Replace placeholders like `your-username`, `your-handle`, and links.
- Put your real headshot at `static/avatar.svg` and social card in `static/`.
